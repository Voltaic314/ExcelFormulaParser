# Excel_Helper_Framework
 This project aims to use a combination of openpyxl and 
 regex string matching to structure and organize spreadsheets. 

 Openpyxl already does a pretty good job of organizing spreadsheets into good OOP code.
 However, the functionality of parsing and handling formulas seems to be quite limited. I hope to extend its functionality in this regard. 

 The goal is to be able to pass in a formula string from a cell value, 
 and be able to completely map out all of its parts and organize it 
 all into a beautiful parsable data structure. As such, the user would
 be able to easily manipulate excel formulas in a safe, reliable, and 
 user friendly way. :)
